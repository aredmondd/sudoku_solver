# sudoku_solver

This program is based on the foundations of the backtracking algorithm. This algorithm tries numbers until it discovers that one does not work. It steps back, and tries others numbers, and repeats this until the whole puzzle is solved. After seeing the slow solution (that takes 9^81 outcomes and just brute force tests them), I was looking for something better. This was my answer.

This was also my first time using github and git, so that was a great learning experience. I look forward to collaborating on projects in the future using git and github!
